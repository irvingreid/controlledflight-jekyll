Irving Reid
<div class="one-line">
Senior/Staff Software Developer
</div>
</h1>
<p>
My strength is seeing beyond the “full stack”; diving in to understand the
details of OS implementation and Internet protocol behaviour or to untangle the
hairiest operational mysteries, while looking outward to the motivations of the
people making, using and paying for software-based systems.
</p>
<p>
I've worked on high availability monolith + microservice SAAS, multi-million user open
source (Firefox and Thunderbird), high performance network services in C and
C++, and access management at both the policy and network level. My career has
ranged over Web security standards committees, network security, enterprise
architecture, multi-tier applications, embedded microcontrollers, systems
administration, and the human and organizational side of software development.
</p>
<p>
Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Scala, C++, Java, C, Perl, Python, Shell, ... on all major OS
platforms. MySQL and other SQL DBs, Kafka, Kubernetes, Nomad, LDAP, SAML, AWS, OpenTelemetry,
and so on. If there's a technology you're using and you need more in-house expertise,
I'll dig in and learn it.
</p>
<p>
Revision control, issue tracking, CI/CD, automated testing, manageable infrastructure, and
high-bandwidth telemetry and monitoring of production systems are all
table stakes; I'll work with whatever you're using or help you move to something better.
