My strength is seeing beyond the “full stack”; diving in to understand the details of OS implementation and Internet protocol behaviour or to untangle the hairiest operational mysteries, while looking outward to the motivations of the people making, using and paying for software-based systems.

I’ve worked on high availability monolith+microservice SAAS, multi-million user open source (Firefox and Thunderbird), high performance network services in C and C++, and access management at both the policy and network level. My career has ranged over Web security standards committees, network security, enterprise architecture, multi-tier applications, embedded microcontrollers, systems administration, and the human and organizational side of software development. I’ve been paid to program in Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Scala, C++, Java, C, Perl, and many others, on all the major OS platforms.
