[Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/archives/two-great-videos-in-plain-english/) posted links to a couple of good videos by Lee Lefever at [Common Craft](http://www.commoncraft.com/): [RSS in Plain English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klgLsSxGsU&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fbokardo%2Ecom%2Farchives%2Ftwo%2Dgreat%2Dvideos%2Din%2Dplain%2Denglish%2F) and [Wikis in Plain English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY).

I’m pretty sure most of my readers are well beyond the intro level with RSS, but they’re worth watching just for the nifty lo-fi presentation style.
