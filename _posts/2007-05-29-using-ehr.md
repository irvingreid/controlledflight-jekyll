[Greg](http://third-bit.com/) sent me a link to a CBC.ca story: [Doctors too slow to embrace electronic health records](http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/05/25/electronic-health-records.html).

My first reaction was “Of course doctors don’t want to use electronic health record systems. Have you looked at them? They’re *nasty*!”

Now, physicians are notorious for resisting change, but we need to step back and think about why they might be resisting this particular change. I see some seeds of it in the CBC article. Almost all of the touted benefits are about making health care professionals do their job *better*. That’s an important goal, but the only way you’re going to get widespread buy-in is if you also make their job *easier*. If there was ever an area that’s ripe for user-centric design, it’s this one.
