Nine and a half years at PagerDuty, and a few months recovering from burnout, later...

Finally moved off WordPress to a static site generator - Jekyll for now, since I've been
writing mostly Ruby for the last few years, but that could change. Profuse thanks to Harald,
who has been putting up with my WP install on his personal server all these years.

First up: doing a Rails performance investigation or two, following up on things
I noticed at my previous employer but didn't have time and brain space to investigate.
