From [After Downing Street](http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/node/22349), via [Brad DeLong](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/05/powells_chief_o.html), describing a radio call-in show discussing public accountability for the Iraq war:

> The first caller who was put on the air demanded an investigation of the lies that launched the war, and asked for accountability “all the way up.” In response to Adelman’s claims that history would hold people accountable, the caller said “I would love to have a job where, worst case scenario, my historical record is flawed.”
