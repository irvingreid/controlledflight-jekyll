This ought to get at least a few of [Adam](http://www.goucher.ca/blog/?p=243)‘s goats. Sadek Drobi over at InfoQ summarizes a debate about certification for programmers where several writers advocate that programmers really should be certified in *testing* software.

[InfoQ: Testing and Quality Control the only Certification Needed?](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/07/certification-testing-Braithwait)

> A new certification for software developers should not be about OOP, metaprogramming, macros, design patterns or any in depth knowledge of programming languages. Reginald Braithwaite believes that only one subject must be on the examination list: testing and quality control.
> 
> Braithwaite stresses that this is not a debate on “whether to have separate testers or whether programmers should test themselves.” He simply asserts that, judging from his experience, safety is of crucial importance for software development in commercial environment. Hence, developers’ ability to ensure that software does what it is expected to do should be the prerequisite to any software development job…

While I’m not sure that any of the certifications currently available in the software business actually add value, the underlying message deserves to be shouted:

**IF YOU DON’T CARE WHETHER YOUR CODE WORKS OR NOT, GET THE HELL OUT OF THE PROFESSION!**

If you don’t know *how* to tell whether your code works or not, it’s pretty clear you don’t care. And if you don’t understand that “works” is defined by your users, not yourself, well…

[Greg](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/), your professional Master’s degree better have lots of Quality in it, with a good dose of User-Centered Engineering.
