My spouse teaches computer science at a Rather Large University. Several years ago one of her students wrote roughly the following in the documentation for one of their assignments:

> When the program receives invalid input it exits ignominiously.

Once again this evening, I found myself chuckling at the thought of a program slinking away in shame because it wasnâ€™t good enough to handle all possible inputs.
