[Adam Goucher](http://www.ninjatactics.com/blog/?p=212), who escaped the Previous Employer before I did, links to an excellent reference on software testing: [Quality Tree Software](http://www.qualitytree.com/)‘s [Test Heuristics Cheat Sheet](http://testobsessed.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/testheuristicscheatsheetv1.pdf). Many thanks to [Elisabeth Hendrickson](http://www.testobsessed.com/2007/02/19/test-heuristics-cheat-sheet) for sharing this with us.

I’m planning to print out a bunch of copies and staple one onto each member of my development team.
